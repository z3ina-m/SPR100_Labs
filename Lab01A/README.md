## Reflection
I faced a few challenges with reading the instructions for part 3. I particulairly struggled with where I insert the code. After reading it a few times I think I figured it out. As for what I learned; I learned how to install VS codes, that I am using WSL the windows subsystem for linux (not pure linux), that I have to save the file in VS code before commiting changes (ctrl s) and many new commands.
